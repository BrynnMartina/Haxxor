        <h2> Hacking for Social Good: Our Problem</h2>
            <body> 
                <p>
                    In response to the "Hack for Social Good" challenge, our team is excited to present a mistake analysis software designed
                    to revolutionize the learning process, particularly in the realm of math education. Recognizing the significant challenges
                    faced by students in understanding and rectifying mistakes in their problem-solving approaches, we set out to create a product 
                    that goes beyond conventional tutoring methods. Our mistake analysis software utilizes advanced pattern recognition algorithms 
                    to dissect how individuals approach and solve math homework problems. By capturing the nuanced steps and methods employed by 
                    users, our software identifies recurring mistakes in their problem-solving journey. 
                    
                    <br> <br> The innovative aspect lies in its ability 
                    to not only pinpoint errors but also generate customized problem sets that specifically target the identified weaknesses. This 
                    ensures a tailored learning experience, focusing on the areas where individuals tend to stumble. Our product aims to empower 
                    learners by providing them with targeted and constructive feedback, fostering a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts 
                    and enhancing their problem-solving skills. Through this endeavor, we believe we can make a lasting impact on education, 
                    promoting inclusivity and offering a valuable tool for both students and educators alike.
